# 🌤️ Weather App in React – FreshStart Dev

This project is a React adaptation of the original Weather App created during the SheCodes workshops. The goal was to convert a fully functional HTML/CSS/JavaScript app into a modern, component-based React application, while maintaining the original visual structure and user experience.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **React**
- **Axios**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS (custom styling based on original)**
- **SheCodes Weather API**
- **Netlify (for deployment)**

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 City-based weather search
- 🌡️ Current temperature, humidity, wind, and weather description
- 🗓️ Date and time formatting
- 📅 5-day weather forecast with icons
- 🌓 Dark mode toggle (with logo switch)
- ✅ Responsive design
- 🔗 Links to GitHub and Netlify for transparency and deployment

## 📦 Structure

The app is broken down into the following components:

- `App.js`: Wraps the entire application, manages global state and dark mode.
- `Header.js`: Contains the logo, search form, and dark mode toggle.
- `Main.js`: Handles API requests, displays current weather and forecast.
- `Footer.js`: Credits, GitHub and Netlify links.
- `App.css`: Styling adapted from the original HTML/CSS version.
- `images/logo.png`: Custom logo (also changes in dark mode).
